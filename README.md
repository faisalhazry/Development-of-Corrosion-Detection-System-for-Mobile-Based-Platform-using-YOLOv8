## I. INTRODUCTION
Corrosion poses immense risks to structures. Current visual inspection methods are time-consuming and subjective. Introducing AI-based corrosion detection using YOLOv8 promises precise, real-time identification on mobile platforms, ensuring safer infrastructure with reduced manual inspections and improved maintenance across industries reliant on metal structures.


## II. METHODOLOGY
### A. Archtecture of the system
This AI-driven corrosion detection system, utilizing a custom YOLOv8 dataset, operates via a mobile interface. Its architecture boasts a web front-end enabling video upload or real-time webcam detection. Powered by Flask, it manages HTTP interactions, file handling, and delivers seamless result viewing for enhanced user experience.

### B. Instance Segmentation detection
For this project, the use of instance segmentation for corrosion detection was proposed. Unlike object detection, instance segmentation not only detects the presence of objects in an image, but also identifies the boundaries of each object instance. This approach can be particularly useful for detecting and analyzing individual instances of corrosion within an image.

1. Object Detection: Firstly, it runs object detection to find all bounding boxes for every object in an image
2. Semantic Segmentation: After finding all the rectangles (bounding boxes), it uses a semantic segmentation model inside every rectangle
3. Instance Segmentation: Masking identifying the boundaries of objects

### C. Dataset Generation
Collected 705 corroded surface images, annotated via Roboflow for instance segmentation. Augmentation doubled dataset to 1398 images through flips and resizing. Split into training (1200), validation (141), and testing (57) sets. Crucial steps: collection, annotation, augmentation, and division for robust ML model development in corrosion detection.

### F. Evaluation
#### i. IOU Intersection over Union
In simple terms, IoU measures the degree of overlap between the predicted bounding box and the ground truth bounding box, expressed as a percentage. A diagrammatic representation of IoU is shown in the accompanying figure[6],
